## Approach using f strings
for item in famous_quotes:
    print(f"{item['quote']} - {item["full_name"].split(" ")[-1]} , {item["full_name"].split(" ")[0]}")


## Alternative approach - use nested loops
for pair in famous_quotes:
    for key, value in reversed(pair.items()): # Use reversed method to iterate backwards
        if key == "quote":
            print(value, end = " - ")
        elif key == "full_name":
            print(value.split(" ")[-1] + ", " + value.split(" ")[0])
